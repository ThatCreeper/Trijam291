A hologram, on the moon! What's not to love.

Easy answer: the maintenance.

Long answer:

It's the year **FUTURE** and now, thanks to modern marvels of technology, humanity has seen itself to its most *profitable* idea yet: advertising on the moon. And profitable it is! Whatever is put onto the big display on the moon (usually a cola product) immediately gets a nice boost on the stock market. Does it impact the circadian rhythms of animals? Don't care! It makes the line go up. And that's *good*.

At least, that's the shareholder perspective.

Your perspective is that you have to fix all the screen panels that keep getting *mysteriously broken*. And what that means is that you have to grab a robot, make sure it gets some spare parts, drag it over to the broken panel, and have it swap out the parts. All things considered, if you keep an eye on your battery, it's fairly simple.

And as long as the "shadows" don't find you.


Made for Trijam #289 over the course of three hours (plus two breaks and a couple minutes post-jam of fixing a horrible audio issue (no gameplay was changed))

This was programmed in C++ using Raylib and a little set of helper utilities that I carry around.
